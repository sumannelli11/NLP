    "Word2Vec is a popular algorithm used in natural language processing (NLP) for generating word embeddings. Word embeddings are dense vector representations of words that capture their meanings, syntactic properties, and relationships with other words. Word2Vec was developed by a team of researchers at Google led by Tomas Mikolov and is based on the idea that words that occur in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Word2Vec Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2Vec uses a neural network model to learn word embeddings from a large corpus of text. There are two main architectures used in Word2Vec:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW)**:\n",
    "    - Predicts the current word based on its context (surrounding words).\n",
    "    - Given a context window (e.g., the words before and after the target word), the model tries to predict the target word.\n",
    "    - For example, in the sentence \"The cat sat on the mat\", if the context window is 2, the context for the word \"sat\" would be [\"The\", \"cat\", \"on\", \"the\"]. The model tries to predict \"sat\" from this context.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Skip-Gram**:\n",
    "    - Predicts the context words from the current word.\n",
    "    - Given a target word, the model tries to predict the surrounding words within a context window.\n",
    "    - Using the same example, if the context window is 2, the model uses \"sat\" to predict [\"The\", \"cat\", \"on\", \"the\"].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training Process\n",
    "\n",
    "The training process involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: Initialize the word vectors with small random values.\n",
    "2. **Training**:\n",
    "    - For CBOW: The model takes the average of the context word vectors and tries to predict the target word.\n",
    "    - For Skip-Gram: The model takes the target word vector and tries to predict the vectors of the context words.\n",
    "3. **Optimization**: Use techniques like gradient descent to adjust the word vectors in such a way that the prediction error is minimized.\n",
    "4. **Output**: After training, the word vectors are learned such that words with similar contexts have vectors close to each other in the vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Using Gensim Library in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a simple example of how to use the Word2Vec model from the Gensim library:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from gensim.models import Word2Vec\n",
    "from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\n",
    "import nltk\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sample sentences\n",
    "sentences = [\n",
    "    \"The cat sat on the mat.\",\n",
    "    \"The dog sat on the log.\",\n",
    "    \"Cats and dogs are pets.\"\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Tokenize sentences\n",
    "tokenized_sentences = [word_tokenize(sentence.lower()) for sentence in sentences]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Train Word2Vec model\n",
    "model = Word2Vec(tokenized_sentences, vector_size=100, window=5, min_count=1, sg=0)  # sg=0 means CBOW, sg=1 means Skip-Gram\n",
    "\n",
    "# Get the vector for a word\n",
    "vector = model.wv['cat']\n",
    "print(vector)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Find similar words\n",
    "similar_words = model.wv.most_similar('cat')\n",
    "print(similar_words)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Context Window**: Determines the number of surrounding words to consider for each target word.\n",
    "- **Vector Size**: Dimensionality of the word vectors. Common sizes are 100, 200, or 300.\n",
    "- **Training Algorithm**: CBOW (faster, good for larger datasets) vs. Skip-Gram (better for small datasets and infrequent words).\n",
    "- **Min Count**: Ignores all words with total frequency lower than this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2Vec is used in various NLP applications, including:\n",
    "- Semantic similarity\n",
    "- Text classification\n",
    "- Named entity recognition\n",
    "- Machine translation\n",
    "- Sentiment analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2Vec's ability to capture semantic relationships between words makes it a powerful tool for many NLP tasks."
